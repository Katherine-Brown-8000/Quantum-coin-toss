# Quantum-coin-toss
Unlike classical computers quantum computers have the potential to generate true randomness. This is done by applying a Hadaamard gate to a qubit, which puts it in a superposition state. When measured the superposition collapses into either a 1 or 0. This simulates an equal probability, this is the coin toss.
